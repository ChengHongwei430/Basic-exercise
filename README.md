Some basic knowledge of algorithms, such as stable sort, non-stable sort and common top ten sort.
1. Bubble sort
Bubbling sort is moving small elements forward or large elements backward, comparison is comparing two adjacent elements, and exchange also occurs between these two elements.
2. Select sort
Selection sort is to select the smallest element for each position, for example, select the smallest in the first position and give the smallest element in the remaining elements. Two elements choose the second smallest, and so on, until the n-1 element, the NTH element does not have to be chosen, because it is only the largest element left.
3. Insert sort
Insertion sort is the insertion of elements one at a time, based on an already ordered small sequence.
